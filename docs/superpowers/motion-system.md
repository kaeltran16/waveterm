# Motion system — reference

The cockpit's shared motion layer: one vocabulary, one token source. Read this before adding
motion to any surface.

The app-wide revamp this came out of is finished — every surface landed between 2026-07-03 and
2026-07-04, so the rollout table that used to live here is gone (the per-surface detail is in the
design specs listed at the bottom, and in git). What remains is the part that still governs new
work: the north star, the shared primitives, the eight moments, and the guardrails.

## North star

- **Functional-first.** Motion must make a state change more legible. Rejection test for any
  candidate animation: *does it make a state change more legible?* If no, it does not ship.
  Delight only rides on top of functional motion, never standalone decoration.
- **Feel = fluid / calm.** Macro moments ~360ms on `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`; micro ~140ms;
  exits ~280ms (leave a touch quicker than they arrive).
- **No new vocabulary per surface.** Reuse the tokens and moment patterns below. If a surface
  genuinely needs a new primitive, add it to the token module first, then use it — never inline a
  one-off duration/ease/keyframe.
- **Reduced-motion is not optional.** Every surface honors it (`<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">`
  for Framer + `motion-reduce:animate-none` on CSS loops).
- **No entrance cascade.** `initial={false}` at the `AnimatePresence`/list level, so mounting a
  populated view does not fire N staggered entrances — only items arriving *after* mount animate.

## Shared foundation

| Artifact | Role |
|---|---|
| `frontend/app/element/motiontokens.ts` | Durations (`durMacro`/`durMicro`/`durExit`), `easeFluid`, variant presets (`cardVariants`, `reorderLift`, `composerReveal`, `popoverReveal`, `reflowProps`) + the `shouldFadeEntry` burst guard. **Import from here; do not inline motion values.** |
| `frontend/app/element/popoverreveal.tsx` | Shared dropdown/popover reveal. Wraps the panel only; callers own positioning + backdrop. Adopted across all live cockpit popovers. |
| `frontend/tailwindsetup.css` | CSS-only ambient loops: `@keyframes pulseDot`, `breatheGlow`, `settle`. Token-colored via `color-mix(... var(--color-*) ...)` — no raw hex. |
| `frontend/app/element/motiontokens.test.ts` | Guards token values + the burst-guard helper. |
| `frontend/app/element/collapsiblerail.tsx` | Reusable right-rail (icon strip ↔ 300px scroll panel); owns the rail-reveal moment and fixes titlebar/rail divider alignment by construction. |

Framer (`motion/react`, v12) is the default tool. CSS is the fallback **only** for perpetual ambient
loops (glow, pulse) and pre-existing hover/press micro-transitions.

## The eight moments

Designed and shipped on the Cockpit surface; every other surface maps its state changes onto this
same vocabulary rather than inventing one.

| # | Moment | Tool | Primitive |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Item entrance | Framer | `cardVariants` (opacity+scale only — never x/y) |
| 2 | Item exit + list reflow | Framer | `<AnimatePresence mode="popLayout">` + `exit` variant + `layout` |
| 3 | Attention / "needs you" | CSS | `breatheGlow` (persistent, token-amber, until resolved) |
| 4 | Completion settle | CSS | `settle` (one-shot soft scale on finish) |
| 5 | Streaming text line | Framer | opacity-only fade + `shouldFadeEntry` burst guard |
| 6 | Inline reveal (composer/panel) | Framer | `composerReveal` (height+opacity) |
| 7 | Status pulse + micro | CSS | `pulseDot` (unified 1.6s) + kept hover/press |
| 8 | Drag lift + drop | Framer | `reorderLift` (`whileDrag`) + `dragTransition` drop-settle |

## Guardrails

- Read `motiontokens.ts` before adding motion to a surface. Reuse; don't reinvent.
- `layout` only on container elements, never on streaming text nodes. Animate transform/opacity
  only (perf).
- CSS keyframes must be token-colored (`var(--color-*)` + `color-mix`) — no raw hex.
- Any live-drag / 1:1-with-pointer interaction stays un-eased. Never animate the drag itself; only
  its aftermath — reflow, settle, snap.
- **No cross-surface container transition.** Each surface's own entrance reveal *is* the swap.
  `CockpitShell` swaps by plain conditional render — no `AnimatePresence`/`layoutId` at that level,
  because a container transition fights the per-surface entrances.
