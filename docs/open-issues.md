# Open issues — consolidated backlog

**This file is the single "what's left" list.** `docs/deferred.md` holds the why; this file holds the
what. New deferrals get their full entry appended to `docs/deferred.md`, then a one-line row here.

Pruned 2026-10-05: every row was re-checked against git and the closed ones removed (the shipped
orchestrator rows F11–F26, the closed scans, the Jarvis Brief B5 table, the recall-arm held items).
Recover the pre-prune list with `git show c99f2041:docs/open-issues.md`. The orchestrator flaw history
(F1–F26) stays in `docs/orchestrator-redesign-flaws.md`.

The rows of that prune were worked as chunks of `effort:c732b933-f976-4263-b191-fd95454c3d84`, archived
2026-10-06 with nothing actionable left (`wsh effort show c732b933-f976-4263-b191-fd95454c3d84`).

Status legend:

- **Actionable** — can be picked up as-is.
- **Blocked** — cannot start until a prerequisite exists.
- **Held** — deliberately deferred pending a named trigger or evidence; do not build off the spec alone.
- **Declined** — decided against; do not resurface.

## 1 · Actionable

- **`final-stage` CDP scenario, Part B flakes** (2026-10-12). B2–B6 failed in 2 of 3 runs after the lead's
  Final verification block was removed from the details rail, and passed in 2 runs without that change
  (one of which failed only B6). The failing shape: in B2 the DAG modal's final node still reads the B1
  state ("waits on every task") while the tree's row shows Tree running, and from B3 on the stage row has
  lost focus (no pane). That change touches neither the modal nor focus, so the cause is unproven either
  way. Repro: `ARC_FINAL_OUT=<dir> node scripts/cdp/final-verify.mjs final-stage`, a few runs.

Tracked in their own initiatives, not here:

- **Arc Claude mod live verify** (usage strip, card answer, Esc, dag child ask, settings hooks) — effort `99832658`, chunk 9.
- **Orchestrator wall-clock** — effort `b1fe5d7e`: live-verify the unit-tested fixes, the round-2 final tree lock, the Timing section live check.

## 2 · Blocked

### Remote/WSL worker host operations

Git surfaces break for SSH/WSL workers because they run on the local host. Not routable today: agent
launch has no connection parameter, `Run`/worktree/`AgentVM` carry no connection field, and the remote
impl doesn't register `GitChangesCommand`/`GitDiffCommand`. Prerequisite chain: (1) remote agent launch
threading connection through launch → run → worktree → `AgentVM`; (2) register host-bound commands on
`wshremote` (or expose `wshserver` handlers over the connection route); (3) then route keyed off the
agent's connection, local default. Effort realistically L counting step 1. Full reference design in git
history (pre-consolidation issue 5). The E8 connserver readiness handshake (patch saved, needs a live
SSH/WSL verify) rides on step 1.

## 3 · Held — pick up only on the named trigger

Each names its revive condition in `docs/deferred.md` unless a source is given.

Cockpit and surfaces:

- **Work on an initiative — "Save place and close"** (2026-09-29) — revive when losing a session's place
  recurs.
- **Run recovery after a restart — New Agent sessions** (2026-09-30) — revive when a session is seen
  re-running its launch prompt.
- **A lead's terminal pane rendering blank while the backend holds its output** (2026-10-05) — seen once,
  2026-09-21, on a lead launched into a freshly restarted dev app: `wavesrv` held 32 KB of scrollback
  (`filestore.db`, `db_file_data`, `name='term'`) and resizing did not repaint. Never reproduced. Revive
  when it is seen again: note the block id and keep `waveapp.log` before touching the pane. No repro
  loop exists, because nothing exposes the xterm buffer to CDP.
- **Cross-surface ideas from the cockpit-focus spec** (2026-09-22; focus itself was removed 2026-10-06) —
  relationship annotation, companion split, time correlation, drag courier.
- **Resource linking beyond navigation** (2026-09-17) — Related Work, the Work Trail strip, structured
  refs, file/diff/commit/session targets (a Usage session page waits on the session target), a shared
  action builder.
- **Cross-surface Back history and its context strip** (2026-09-17) — parked as `09e86573` on
  `feat/surface-integration`; keep the branch while this is open.
- **Composer attachments** (2026-09-18) — the New run goal has them since 2026-10-12; revive the Steer half
  and drag-drop when attaching a file to a steer is wanted.
- **Incremental stateful transcript projection** — only if the capped re-project profiles hot (CDP /
  React-DevTools pass against a populated cockpit first).

Orchestrator:

- **Cross-run Verify hold under `--landing checkout`** (2026-09-15) — one run's failed Verify does not
  hold another run's merges in the same checkout. Branch landing, the default, is unaffected.
- **Lead-authored task routing, Phase 4** (2026-09-17) — the cost/outcome measurement gate. Revive on
  evidence that cheap-first routing waste is common.
- **DAG liveness batching (M1)** — 42.7 ms per running task per 30 s tick on 191 session files; build
  the per-schedule snapshot only when the corpus nears ~3,000 files.
- **Automated board rendering** for the final verifier — revive when a verdict misses a layout defect a
  rendered board would have caught (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-orchestrator-findings-fixes-design.md` §5).
- **A cheap-model route for judging sessions** — revive when the judging roles are a material share of
  a run's tokens (same spec).
- **An idle-lead watchdog after the dag is done** — revive on a run whose lead sat idle at `run
  finished` without completing (same spec).

Radar:

- **Metadata collectors and the clustering pipeline** (retired 2026-10-06) — revive when chunk 8 of
  `effort:1557171a-e61d-4b29-83fd-fc7f818e6131` measures the fix-sibling audit as not worth keeping.
- **Security review audits** (held 2026-10-13) — revive with a classifier flag for trust-boundary commits
  and a fresh probe; `docs/deferred.md` keeps the probe's prompt.
- **Missing test coverage audits** (held 2026-10-13) — revive if Radar is to report test gaps as their own
  finding type; `docs/deferred.md` keeps the probe's prompt.

Jarvis (what survived the 2026-09-22/23 memory and recall-arm removals):

- **U2 Tasks:** in-Wave `## Notes` editing; decision supersede UI (backend `SupersedeDecision` exists);
  manual dossier creation; live push.
- **U3 Graph:** search/filter; read rail; cross-surface nav out of a node; whole-vault attribution; the
  visual constants (opacity/width/dash/`RUN_SQUARE_SCALE`) want a dense-vault legibility check.
- **E Continuity:** a cheap model tier for boundary summaries; completed-task prose re-freshness; a
  per-task resume card beyond the pet's newest-narrative peek.
- **D attribution tuning:** `timeBoxMs` 30d, `weightLayer3` 0.3 (needs a human ground-truth pass),
  `weightLayer2` 0.8 (needs dispatch goals carrying ticket ids).
- **Jarvis Briefing:** generic cross-project progress needs a Wave-owned workstream/milestone contract —
  its own product/data-model session.
- **Pet:** courier gestures (build the store and the gestures together); higher acting tiers.
- **Pi Part B:** `wave_create_widget` pi tool + `wsh widget` vdom CLI — when a concrete consumer appears.

## 4 · Declined / permanent limitations (do not resurface)

- Cockpit light/Paper theme — declined; code removed 2026-08-24 (`docs/deferred.md`).
- Gatekeeper v1.1 (make-a-rule + countdown) — revive only on recurring-ask or misfire evidence. Measured
  2026-10-12 over 879 structured asks since 08-11: 737 distinct headers, and the ones that recur (spec
  review, scope, plan review, commit) are approval gates, not routine asks a rule could answer.
- Arc Environment capability — restore via `git show 4e80bf4f:docs/environment-roadmap.md` if needed.
- Agents-tab fit-one-screen density engine — obsolete, un-executable against the card grid.
- Diff-surface row-density variants and the rest of the narrow-window cascade — the commit column fold
  shipped (`19d324e5`); the rest only on a narrow-window user.
- Rate-limit token *cap* and plan-tier badge — no honest Anthropic-side source.
- Codex/OpenAI 5h-window bars — Codex has no such window.
- Codex subagents + depth>1 subagent nesting — no per-subagent files exist; closed no-go.
- Usage pricing family-substring drift (historical Opus billed at current tier) — accepted estimate error.
- Codex and opencode as run workers — declined 2026-09-17: this install only uses claude and pi.
  Recovery path: `docs/deferred.md` 2026-09-14 entry.
- Final stage: persisting a verifier's verdict held during Checking — declined 2026-09-30.
- The memory subsystem and the Jarvis recall arm (Ask, proactive cards, embeddings) — removed
  2026-09-22/23 on measured usage. Revive only on evidence that note bodies, not index lines, change an
  agent's behaviour (`docs/deferred.md`).
