// The Brief's detail sheet draws the active subject, so this is the routing table that decides which
// subjects it owns. It replaces stagecompose.ts, which answered the same question for the Stage's panes —
// and it stays exhaustive on purpose: with the Stage gone, "none" is a claim that another Brief surface
// renders that kind, so a kind that fell through by accident would vanish rather than fail to compile.
//
// `run` is the resolved run for a channel subject (stageRunAtom). A channel with no run is not an empty
// sheet: it is the launcher, which is the only place a run can be started from in the Brief.
